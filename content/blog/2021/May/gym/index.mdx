import MyPage from "../../../../../src/components/gym" 

This demo uses a 360 image of a fitness center.  It's an example of the style used in some training and 'tour' experiences.   
<br/><br/>Included in the scene are some Three.js cubes which demonstrate how photographic and Three.js objects can appear to live alongside eachother.   
Use your mouse/touch to look around
