This demo uses a simple 360 image of a fitness center.  It's an example of the style used in some training and 'tour' experiences.  
<br></br><br></br>Included in the scene are some Three.js cubes which demonstrate how photographic and Three.js objects can appear to live alongside eachother.

There is no movement or purpose to the scene yet... the next step would be to add some interaction with hotspots and instructions.
