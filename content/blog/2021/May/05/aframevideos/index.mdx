Here's a slight'y wobbly GPS based AR demo, made with Three.JS and A-Frame together.<br/><br/>

Using a combination of tools, this is a basic plane flight path.  This plane is animated in Blender, exported GLTF to an A-FRAME object that's moved around by Three.js animation loop translated to metres.  <br/><br/>
